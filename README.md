# 10-SQLAlchemy-Challenge


Overview
This project uses SQLAlchemy, Python, Flask, Pandas and Matplotlib for analysis and exploration of Hawaiian temperatures. It is composed of two parts. Part one involves using SQLAlchemy to connect to the SQL file, then performing an exploratory precipitation analysis followed by an exploratory station analysis and create a histogram. Part two uses python to create a Flask API with SQLAlchemy ORM to query the database through various routes

Resources
Jupyter notebook file
SQLite file
CSV files for Hawaiian measurements and stations
